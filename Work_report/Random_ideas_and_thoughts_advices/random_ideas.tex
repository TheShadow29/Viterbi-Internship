\subsection{NN for finding what the hidden layers of the Net are doing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can try to analyze the hidden layers, to find which nodes are the ones which are capturing illumination invariant features and stuff like that.
\end{itemize}

\section{NN}
\subsection{Filtering automatically with CNN}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can try to remove the data bias from the database, by physically removing them using another NN
\item Or perhaps automatically learning that these are not exactly relevant.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training NN}
\begin{itemize}
\item To do a task, we can think of how a normal human being would approach that task.
\item Can ask the machine learner to do that on its own.
\item This would implicitly lead to learning objects on its own.
\end{itemize}


\section{Important Tips : By Prof. Ram Nevatia}
\begin{itemize}
\item Whatever written in the paper, is written very nicely. Do not change the work flow for poster, or even the content or representation. Has happened with the prof said that pains in changing the course plan from one assignment to another. 
\end{itemize}
