\section{Daily Progress}
\subsection{Week 15 May to 21 May}
\subsubsection{15 May : Monday}
Accomplished :
\begin{itemize}
\item Read the paper Face Recog using deep multi pose representation halfway through.
\item Watched and implemented tensorflow tutorials by Marvon Zhou till Lec15.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{16 May : Tuesday}
Target :
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete the Face Recog using deep multi pose representation.
\item Watch NN course  and complete till week 10 (curr status at week 6).
\item Read Do We really need million faces.
\end{itemize}
Accomplished:
\begin{itemize}
\item Completed reading teh Face Recog using deep multi pose representation
\item Started reading Do We really need million faces [upto page 4]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{17 May : Wednesday}
Target :
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete Do We really need million faces
\item Complete the other two papers as well : A multi scale cascade fully convolutional network face detector, regressing parameters for 3DMM
\item Finish upto week 10
\end{itemize}
Accomplished :
\begin{itemize}
\item Complted two papers : Do we really need million faces, and multi scale cascade fcn face detector, and started regressing parameters for 3DMM
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{18 May : Thursday}
Target :
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete regressing 3DMM parameters
\item Complete till week 10 from NN
\item Also try to do the course CS231n Stanford : CNN for Visual Recognition. 
\end{itemize}
Accomplished :
\begin{itemize}
\item Slight part of regressing 3DMM parameters is left, but will leaving it as is.
\item Downloaded the new papers, and had a brief overview regarding that.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{19 May : Friday}
Target :
\begin{itemize}
\item Read all the  4 papers regarding MediFor.
\item Complete till week 10 from NN
\item Also see CS231n Stanford course.
\end{itemize}

Accomplished :
\begin{itemize}
\item Got a new Problem Statement :
  Given an image, need to develop a score map which can say wheather or not this image was taken in that location or not.
\item Downloaded places365, need to start working with it.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{20 May : Saturday}
No work done.

\subsubsection{21 May : Sunday}
No work done.

\subsection{Week 22 May to 28 May}
\subsubsection{22 May : Monday}
Target:
\begin{itemize}
\item Read im2gps paper, unsupervised visual representation learning by context prediction.
\item Get places365 running nicely, and try to replicate the results.
\item Complete till week 10 of NN course.
\item Understand the problem statement once again.
\item Get a hang of Caffe.
\end{itemize}
Accomplished:
\begin{itemize}
\item Read im2gps paper. Mildly interesting, mostly experiments. Didn't really explain well what it wanted to show.
\item Read the unsupervised Visual representation learning by context prediction.
\item Did the lec6e finally, and started lec7 of NN course.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{23 May : Tuesday}
Target:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get hang of how to use Caffe.
\item Get Places-CNN working.
\end{itemize}

Accomplished:
\begin{itemize}
\item Got a good hang of caffe. Tried 3 hands on examples.
\item The places365 website was down for some, reason, couldn't really do anything on that.
\item Read first 3 lectures of CS231n. Tried few hands on examples.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{24 May : Wednesday}
Target:
\begin{itemize}
\item Get Places-CNN working on laptop. Train if required. See github for reference (site is also up).
\end{itemize}


\section{Weekly Progress}
\subsection{Week 1}
Accomplished:
\begin{itemize}
\item Read 4 papers on Face Recog, but then the project was itself scraped, and I was given a new project.
\item Read 2 papers (2nd paper near to completion) on Friday.
\item Understood the new project on MediFor, but that might be slightly changed in the near future.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Week 2}
Target :
\begin{itemize}
\item Try to complete the NN course (all weeks[16]).
\item Read papers on the image geolocalization topic.
\item Try to replicate the Places-CNN paper results at the earliest.
\end{itemize}
