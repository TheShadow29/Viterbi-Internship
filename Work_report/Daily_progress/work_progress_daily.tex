\section{Daily Progress}
\subsection{Week 15 May to 21 May}
\subsubsection{15 May : Monday}
Accomplished :
\begin{itemize}
\item Read the paper Face Recog using deep multi pose representation halfway through.
\item Watched and implemented tensorflow tutorials by Marvon Zhou till Lec15.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{16 May : Tuesday}
Target :
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete the Face Recog using deep multi pose representation.
\item Watch NN course  and complete till week 10 (curr status at week 6).
\item Read Do We really need million faces.
\end{itemize}
Accomplished:
\begin{itemize}
\item Completed reading teh Face Recog using deep multi pose representation
\item Started reading Do We really need million faces [upto page 4]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{17 May : Wednesday}
Target :
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete Do We really need million faces
\item Complete the other two papers as well : A multi scale cascade fully convolutional network face detector, regressing parameters for 3DMM
\item Finish upto week 10
\end{itemize}
Accomplished :
\begin{itemize}
\item Complted two papers : Do we really need million faces, and multi scale cascade fcn face detector, and started regressing parameters for 3DMM
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{18 May : Thursday}
Target :
\begin{itemize}
\item Complete regressing 3DMM parameters
\item Complete till week 10 from NN
\item Also try to do the course CS231n Stanford : CNN for Visual Recognition. 
\end{itemize}
Accomplished :
\begin{itemize}
\item Slight part of regressing 3DMM parameters is left, but will leaving it as is.
\item Downloaded the new papers, and had a brief overview regarding that.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{19 May : Friday}
Target :
\begin{itemize}
\item Read all the  4 papers regarding MediFor.
\item Complete till week 10 from NN
\item Also see CS231n Stanford course.
\end{itemize}

Accomplished :
\begin{itemize}
\item Got a new Problem Statement :
  Given an image, need to develop a score map which can say wheather or not this image was taken in that location or not.
\end{itemize}
