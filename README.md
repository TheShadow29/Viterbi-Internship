# Viterbi-Internship
My work at USC Viterbi Summer 2017
* Face Recognition project was initially decided but then changed to MediFor, so it only contains references for that project.
* All work has been done on the MediFor Project and most of it resides in that folder. For code structure see README file inside the folder.
* Software tools tutorial is a folder for self-teaching some deep learning tutorials. This is not really related to the project.
* Work Report contains the Intern Diary, my targets and accomplishments of the day. Also contains the final report.
* my_proj : virtualenv but then I realized a simple pip freeze can achieve the same thing much more easily.
